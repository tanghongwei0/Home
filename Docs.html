            <p>Hey there!You're looking at the docs for an Official Bootstrap Theme-thanks for your purchase! This theme
                has been lovingly crafted by Bootstrap's founders and friends to help you build awesome projects on the
                web.Let's dive in.</p>
            <p>Each theme is designed as it's own toolkit-a series of well designed,intuitive,and cohesive
                components-built on top of Bootstrap.If you've used Bootstrap itself,you'll find this all super
                familiar,but with new aesthetics,new components,beautiful and extensive examples,and easy-to-use build
                tools and documentation.</p>
